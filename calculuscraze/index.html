                    <p>The objective of this website is to provide online resources dedicated to teaching calculus. It is mainly focused on students but can also be interesting for anyone fascinated by mathematics and looking to expand their knowledge in the area of calculus. The resources are presented, especially through various YouTube channels specialized in teaching calculus, and also through reviews of books dedicated to calculus. Personally, I found learning calculus to be very challenging. Mastering calculus can be a difficult task, but with the right resources and materials, one can conquer the subject.</p>
