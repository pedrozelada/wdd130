    <p>Hello everyone, I'm Pedro Zelada, I'm in the software development program. 
        In my free time I like to play violin, read and watch series,</p>
    <p>I also love to play pool. I am not married yet, nor do I have children, 
        I work teaching calculus, I am skilled in mathematics. </p>
    <p>I would like to create a website in the future so this course will be of great help. </p> 
    </p>
    <p>I served as a missionary in Ecuador, and the church has been a great blessing in my life. I hope you have a good day.</p>
